\eblettrine{T}{his thesis was typeset} using \LaTeX, originally developed by
Leslie Lamport and based on Donald Knuth's \TeX. The body text is set in 11
point Egenolff-Berner Garamond, a revival of Claude Garamont's humanist
typeface. The monospaced text is set in 10 point Inconsolata. The interactive
Python interpreter sessions and their graphic output were managed by
\emph{abjad-book}, a tool for executing and embedding Python code and music
notation in \LaTeX documents. Notation examples were rendered by LilyPond and
graph-theoretic examples were rendered by Graphviz.

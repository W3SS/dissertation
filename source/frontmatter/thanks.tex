\begin{hangparas}{2em}{1}A Sorcerer by the power of his magick had subdued all things to himself.

Would he travel? He could fly through space more swiftly than the stars.

Would he eat, drink, and take his pleasure? There was none that did not
instantly obey his bidding.

In the whole system of ten million times ten million spheres upon the two and
twenty million planes he had his desire.

And with all this he was but himself.

Alas!

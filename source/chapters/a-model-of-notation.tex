Abjad models notation.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{The illustration protocol}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

foo

\begin{markdown}
-   print()
-   repr() and __repr__()
-   str() and __str__()
-   format() and __format__()
-   show() and __illustrate__()
-   graph() and __graph__()
\end{markdown}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Components, leaves \& containers}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{markdown}
-   The score tree
-   Component
-   Count-time components
-   Non-count-time components
-   One, and only one, parent per component. They *cannot* be in more than one
    container. This is both confusing, and liable to cause reference problems.
\end{markdown}

\subsection{Leaves}

\begin{markdown}
-   Leaf
-   These are components which do not contain other components.
-   Note
-   Rest
-   Chord
-   NoteHead
\end{markdown}

\subsection{Containers}

\begin{markdown}
-   Container
-   LilyPond and { }
-   Measure
-   LilyPond has no explicit measures
-   Tuplet and FixedDurationTuplet
\end{markdown}

\subsection{Contexts}

\begin{markdown}
-   Context
-   Contexts are containers, but not *count-time*
-   Voice
-   Staff
-   StaffGroup
-   Score
\end{markdown}

\subsection{Inspection}

\begin{markdown}
-   inspect_()
-   not *inspect()*, as that would cause a name conflict with Python's inspect
    module
-   inspect(...).get_parentage()
\end{markdown}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
upper_staff = Staff(name='Upper Staff')
lower_staff = Staff(name='Lower Staff')
staff_group = StaffGroup([upper_staff, lower_staff])
score = Score([staff_group])
</abjad>
\end{comment}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Durations, offsets \& timespans}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

foo

\subsection{Operations on durations}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
Duration(1, 2) + Duration(3, 4)
Offset(1, 2) + Duration(3, 4)
Offset(7, 8) - Offset(1, 12)
</abjad>
\end{comment}

\subsection{Inspecting durations}

\begin{markdown}
-   inspect_(...).get_duration()
-   inspect_(...).get_timespan()
-   in_seconds=True
\end{markdown}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
transposition = pitchtools.Transposition(1)
show(transposition(pitch_segment))
</abjad>

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
inversion = pitchtools.Inversion()
show(inversion(pitch_segment))
inversion_with_axis = pitchtools.Inversion(axis=NamedPitch("d'"))
show(inversion_with_axis(pitch_segment))
</abjad>
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
retrogression = pitchtools.Retrogression()
show(retrogression(pitch_segment))
</abjad>
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
untransposing_rotation = pitchtools.Rotation(-1, transpose=False)
show(untransposing_rotation(pitch_segment))
transposing_rotation = pitchtools.Rotation(-1, transpose=True)
show(transposing_rotation(pitch_segment))
</abjad>
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
multiplication = pitchtools.Multiplication(3)
show(multiplication(pitch_segment))
</abjad>
\end{comment}

\begin{comment}
<abjad>
pitch_operation = pitchtools.PitchOperation(
    operators=(
        pitchtools.Rotation(1),
        pitchtools.Transposition(2),
        ),
    )
show(pitch_operation(pitch_segment))

# Maquettes and unfolding processes

- Timespans allow for large scale phrasing and density structures.
- They simply model attack points and durations, making attack and overlap
  density easy to play with.
- Timespan annotations allow for maquette-like composition techniques, or
  working in a way that conceptually mirrors working with a DAW, even though
  there is no real graphic output except for notation itself.
- Annotations can act as a description of what sort of material should appear
  in what locations -- both horizontally in time and vertically in the score
  hierarchy.
- Timespans also allow for overlap, and have affordances for masking.
- This allows timespans to be created by a factories in layers, and those
  layers resolved down to a single non-overlapping layer via masking.

# Patterns and randomness

- All of the maker tools described here (and in the next chapter) emphasize
  working with patterns.
- Sufficiently complex patterns of discrete numbers (and combinations of
  patterns) are perceptually indistinguishable from randomness. It doesn't
  take much.
- Likewise, randomness -- no matter how it is arrived at, windowed, weighted
  and so forth -- is a kind of maintenance burden. How can you know that
  your compositional machinery is behaving correctly when the results are
  always different by design?
- Why the extensive use of patterns rather than anything else?
- Patterns are sufficient
- They are also testable

# Architecture and extensibility

- Only a few recipes for timespan and rhythm creation have been outlined
  here. Obviously, many more are possible, with other paradigms. The models
  described here generally rely on patterns. Other work could create
  rhythm-makers which take pitches as input, or which follow breakpoints, or
  mimic some other external structure. Likewise with timespan-makers. More
  work could be done to create stronger intentional interrelations between
  timespans.
- One of the strengths in the overall design philosophy described throughout
  this chapter is extensibility. Just because I *haven't* yet created a
  derived-from-bird-song rhythm-maker doesn't mean I can't. Such a maker
  could be created and follow the same interface as all other rhythm-makers,
  benefitting from their foundation of shared notational logics.
- More factories are possible
- Those outlined here are neither the *only* nor the *best* possible
  factories one could design
- New factories can make use of the interfaces implemented by these
  factory families (timespan- and rhythm-makers)
- New factories can also propose entirely new ways of working
  (such as...)
- Extensibility is afforded because the basic building blocks --
  timespans, timespan inventories, meter and Abjad's model of score --
  are rock solid

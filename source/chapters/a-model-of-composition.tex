\chapter{\emph{Consort}: a model of composition}

Specification versus interpretation

(This - in some way - separates "content" from "presentation".)

What is specification? What is a specifier? What is configuration and
aggregation?

What should happen musically, where should it happen?

What is material?

What is music?

Rhythm is interpreted first, as all other parameters depend on it.

Rhythm is interpreted from "coarse" to "fine": from the level of phrase
boundaries to the level of individual notes, rests, tuplets and ties.

This discussion only focuses on notation, nothing related to aesthetic
experience, physical modeling or anything else. This is a tool for a specific
composer to create scores, not a discussion explicitly of why they would work
this way (although that should be discussed in the conclusion).

Specification and interpretation conceive of the score as a single, hugely
complex expression.

Templating as variation.

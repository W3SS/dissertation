%\begin{markdown}
%-   khml
%    -   An early example of maquette
%-   nptl_b
%    -   Max to spreadsheets, then by hand
%    -   Notion of parametric specification
%-   mbrsi
%    -   Max to spreadsheets, then by hand
%    -   Notion of timespans already established
%    -   Incredibly labor intensive
%    -   Attempted to automate via Illustrator, failed
%    -   One single fabric, unfolding
%    -   Impossible to maquette different textures together
%-   aurora
%    -   Revived the project, years later
%    -   Implemented entirely in Python with Abjad
%    -   Rendered by LilyPond
%    -   Finally possible to maquette textures
%    -   No time-signature changes possible: as though on flat grid
%-   plague water
%    -   Time signatures!
%-   invisible cities
%    -   Modernized the work done in plague water

%\section{Historical Background}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\begin{markdown}
%-   Patchwork
%-   OpenMusic
%-   PWGL
%-   Bach
%-   SuperCollider
%-   Score
%-   Rhinoceros and Grasshopper
%-   Why didn't I use any of these?
%    -   I realized text-based work was the right way to go
%    -   Rapid prototyping, legibility, visualization all important
%    -   Need a well-maintained language

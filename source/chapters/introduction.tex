\section{Intent}
\label{sec:intent}

The intent of this dissertation

-   Desire to describe the process by which a score is created
-   To model the musical objects, both notational and compositional explicitly
-   Formalized score control
-   automated typesetting
-   Modern software development techniques, 

To provide a full documentation of the process of working in a formalized way,
from the low-level notational primitives through to high-level descriptions of
large-scale structure, with considerable time spent on the work in the
mid-ground, as well as proposed solutions to the practical concerns of software
development and document preparation.

Score as inseparable from the software that created

Introduce Abjad, Consort, LilyPond, Python and \LaTeX{}

Modeling acoustic music in similar ways to electronic music. How to transfer
that same facility I found in the transformations of fixed-media pieces into 
the notated domain.

Modeling is inevitably the answer: A model of notation, a model of composition.
Automated typesetting greases the wheel.

\section{Background}
\label{sec:background}

Computer-assisted composition has a long history, many practitioners, and a
tremendous number of tools to work with.

Xenakis' massed string music, Curtis Roads' granular explorations, Trevor
Wishart's schema of textural transformations.

Some of the most important tools available contemporary with my entry into the
field include OpenMusic, PWGL, Common Lisp music, and somewhat later the BACH
library for use with modern versions of Max, as well as a whole host of more
marginal experiments including LilyCollider which provides an interface between
SuperCollider -- generally used for live electronics -- and LilyPond.

My earliest experiments with computer-assisted composition involved Max/MSP,
writing patches to generate tabular data from various noise functions which I
collected into spreadsheets and painstakingly notated by hand.

Poor model - highly implicit. No automated typesetting.

That work culminated at the end of my undergraduate study in 2006 with the
never-completed score \emph{mbrsi} -- excerpted in \autoref{fig:mbrsi-score},
with spreadsheet \enquote{sources} in \autoref{fig:mbrsi-lh} and
\autoref{fig:mbrsi-rh} --, whose textural fabric of massed strings attempted to
crystallize the possibilities I felt in granular synthesis at the time: a kind
of sparkling, nervous energy hovering between a flame and the strange
Bezier-cloud outlined by starling swarms. Unfortunately, the process of simply
notating the piece by hand was gruelling, and effectively forbade any effort at
compositional exploration, let alone revising. I set it aside and spent the
next few years looking for alternative approaches to formalizing large-scale
structure in score.

at computationally modeling massed performers with timespans to create an
evolving \enquote{granular} texture. The instructions for the score were
created through a variety of Max/MSP patches which painstakingly converted
noise functions into text files which I then collated into spreadsheets. The
score itself was drawn by hand on size A1 graph paper with Rapidographs.
I completed seventeen of the intended fifty-three pages before stopping for the
sake of my wrists and due a general lack of faith in the project. While still
incomplete, the concerns that motivated this score remain with me.}

A number of years later, at the beginning of my graduate studies, I was
introduced to first LilyPond, and then Abjad.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}


\section{Overview of the dissertation}
\label{sec:overview-of-the-dissertation}

This dissertation consists of six chapters of prose -- including this chapter
--, followed by five chapters each presenting a score, and four extensive
appendices comprising complete code listings for the implementations of the
three most recent scores and of Consort. Please consult the source for Abjad
version 2.16\footnote{https://github.com/Abjad/abjad/releases/tag/2.16}
directly, as it is far too large to include here.

The first six chapters discuss  

Chapter 2 presents an overview of Abjad, detailing its structure and usage in
the creation of scores. The objects comprising Abjad's core notation model,
\emph{components}, \emph{indicators} and \emph{spanners}, are introduced, and
the techniques by which those objects are aggregated into scores, inspected,
selected, iterated over, mutated, persisted to disk, and visualized are
demonstrated at length.

Chapter 3 expands on chapter 2, discussing various models of musical time
implemented in Abjad, and introducing many of tools and techniques employed in
Consort to create large-scale musical works. Timespans -- objects which model a
duration of time positioned along a timeline without regard for score
hierarchy --, as well as collections of timespans, and operations applied
against both single timespans and their collections, are presented as a means
for modeling high-level phrasing and score structure. Highly-configurable
factory classes for programmatically creating both timespan and rhythmic
structures are introduced along with a hierarchical model of meter which
affords coordination between the two models of time.

Chapter 4 analyzes the mechanisms implemented in Consort's model of composition
to specify the structure of musical score at a high level and to interpret
those specifications into completely-notated segments of music.

- Specification
- Rhythmic interpretation
- Non-rhythmic interpretation

Chapter 5 proposes standardized solutions to practical concerns surrounding the
composition of scores in software, such as score package layout on the
file-system, typesetting workflows, version control, and testing. The means by
which an individual score segment, as described in chapter 4, is combined with
many other segments to create a complete work is presented, and the document
preparation techniques necessary for automating the extraction of parts in
LilyPond and producing the various non-musical component documents of a score
with \LaTeX{} are also introduced.

Chapter 6, the conclusion to the prose portion of the dissertation, summarizes
the previously presented research, suggests some implications and failings, and
proposes directions for future work.

The remaining chapters consist of five scores, all composed computationally
with Abjad and LilyPond, both prior to and after the development of Consort.

Chapter 7 presents \emph{Aurora} (2011), for string orchestra, which 
represents the results of my first formal research into composition with
timespan structures, as well as my first formalized work which allowed multiple
distinct textures to overlap. This score implemented a very rudimentary version
of the \enquote{specify \& interpret} pattern enshrined in Consort.

Chapter 8 presents \emph{Plague Water} (2014), for baritone saxophone, electric
guitar, piano and percussion, my first attempt at composing scores in segments
through explicit specification and interpretation, and whose code-base
provided Consort's foundation.

Chapters 9, 10 and 11 present a set of pieces, \emph{Invisible Cities
(i): Zaira} (2014), for eight players, \emph{Invisible Cities (ii): Armilla}
(2015), for viola duet, and \emph{Invisible Cities (iii): Ersilia} (2015), for
chamber orchestra, all implemented via Consort. These three scores demonstrate
Consort's flexibility as tool for structuring both large and small ensemble
works of widely divergent textures, notated both conservatively -- as in
\emph{Zaira} and \emph{Ersilia} -- and with more complex tablature -- as in
Armilla.

Finally, the appendices contain the source to all classes and functions
implemented in Consort -- as of the time of this writing --, as well as the
source to all material and segment definitions, as well as any LilyPond
stylesheets, for the three Invisible Cities scores. My sincere hope is that
these appendices provide a concrete, \enquote{reverse-engineerable} even, link
between the descriptions of my research into formalized score control and the
scores I have actually written with those tools.

%
%# What is this?
%
%Laying out the terms.
%
%This is an analysis of a model of composition, implemented computationally.
%
%This is not an analysis of any works, although works are included.
%
%This is not a survey of techniques used by composers working in
%computer-assisted composition, but the work of one composer implementing for
%the specifics of his own process. This work may well be applicable to others in
%many ways, but I do not claim universality.
%
%Provide a description of formalized score control.
%
%Mention Abjad, Python, LilyPond and LaTeX very briefly. Drop names as
%appropriate.
%
%My aim is to provide a sufficiently detailed explanation of the theory behind
%this work as well as my specific implementation that those who read
%this would be able to consult the source to each of the three Invisible Cities
%scores included in the appendices and make some (or a lot of) sense of them.
%
%It is then, more of a tutorial than anything else, presented in order to
%explain the architectural decisions, implementations and implications behind a
%system designed to assist in the composition of music.
%
%# Background
%
%Mention Trevor Wishart's \emph{On Sonic Art} with regard to textural variation,
%and Curtis Roads' \emph{Microsound} for granular techniques.
%
%Both historical and personal.
%
%Provide wider discussion of Abjad, Python, LilyPond and LaTeX.
%
%Differentiate from Max, PWGL, OM.
